/**
 The following enum defines error codes that should be 
 used if errors are detected or reported.
 These error codes will be used across the different compilers
 and processors (up to the server). Since enums sizes are not the
 same on all compilers, care must be taken if the enum is stored
 in a file or transmitted via a link.
 The assumption is therefor made that enums are 2 bytes, 16-bits,
 when saved or transmitted. It is therefore good practice to always
 cast the enum to an unsigned 16 bit value before saving or transmitting it.
 e.g. (uint16_t) ERR_COMMS_TIMEOUT;
 In cases where only  8 bits are available the least 8 significant bits should be used.
 The upper 8 bits are free for the function to use for what ever purpose except for 
 the first 10 enums where the 8 most significant bits should always be 0.
